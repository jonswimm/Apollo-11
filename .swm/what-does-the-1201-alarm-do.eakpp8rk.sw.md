title: what does the 1201 alarm do
file_version: 1.1.3
app_version: 1.18.0
---

This code was designed to avoid overloading the astronauts with less important alarms so that important functions of the computer could continue keeping in mind the limited RAM on the onboard computer.

<br/>

In the `ALARM_AND_ABORT.agc` file, there is a subroutine named `ALARM`. This subroutine is responsible for turning on the program alarm light when an alarm condition occurs, but it does not display the alarm. The alarm number is passed to this subroutine as an argument. If the `FAILREG` register is not empty, it means that there are already some alarms in the system, and the subroutine will handle these alarms accordingly.
